# AdvJ - Magic101
A system of classes for a magic game. 
A parent class - Enemy holding the common attributes between monster, slime, and dragon
Monsters are capable of leveling up and going across different terrain
Slimes are common little monsters with different colors and poison values
Dragons are good or bad, metallic or chromatic, and fire breathing or not, but large fearsome lizards nonetheless

Players can so far only have the Sorcerer class - which also has the opportunity for healing.
